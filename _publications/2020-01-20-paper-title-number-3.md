excerpt: 'Based on the work of AutoDeeplab, due to its high memory consumption, this paper proposed Simple Path Sampling Strategy, enabled the searching phase consume lower GPU memory than the past. Further, this paper also proposed entropy compensation onto existing objective, which benefits the searching phase and the convergence of the final architecture. The derived architecture achieved better result with more efficient design than the existing methods on the same dataset'

Based on the work of AutoDeeplab, due to its high memory consumption, this paper proposed Simple Path Sampling Strategy, enabled the searching phase consume lower GPU memory than the past. Further, this paper also proposed entropy compensation onto existing objective, which benefits the searching phase and the convergence of the final architecture. The derived architecture achieved better result with more efficient design than the existing methods on the same dataset.
