Master student in Northeast Forestry University, instructed by Prof. Weipeng Jing. My current research interest is employing Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to do some analysis on Remote Sensing Images, especially segmentation on aerial images. Since I will graduate in 2021-07, I am struggling to seek my Ph.D. metors, /sad :(
